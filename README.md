# CTF-Challenge

## Overview

This Docker container hosts four self-contained capture-the-flag challenges.  
Each challenge demonstrates a core cyber-security skill area:
packet analysis, service enumeration, basic cryptography, and file metadata inspection.  
All tools needed are already installed inside the container.
